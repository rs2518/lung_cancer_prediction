# Classifying non-small cell lung cancer cases
A personal project to showcase a more complete body of health data science work and to further develop skills that I have gained since the first attempt (see [SPH029 - Machine Learning project](https://github.com/rs2518/sph029_ml)). This aims to investigate a different set of machine learning models, albeit more rigorously. 

Data source: [A merged lung cancer transcriptome dataset for clinical predictive modelling - Su Bin Lim et al. (2018)](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018136)


## Overview
The aim of this project is to explore the use of machine learning for the prediction of lung cancer. In particular, I will apply different machine learning techniques on microarray expression levels from a lung cancer transcriptome dataset[^1] in order to classify Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases.
